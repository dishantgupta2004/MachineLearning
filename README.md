# Machine Learning

This repository contains **machine learning lectures, assignments, and practice notebooks**
completed as part of the **PW Skills Full Stack Data Science program** (taken ~2 years ago).

The content covers core ML foundations including:
linear and logistic regression, regularization (Lasso/Ridge/Elastic Net),
EDA, multicollinearity analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and basic ML projects.

Notebooks are primarily **educational and exploratory**, focusing on concept clarity
rather than production-level optimization.

This repository is maintained as a **learning archive and reference**
to track foundational ML understanding and progression over time.
